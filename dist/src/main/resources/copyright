    REDLINK SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

    These license terms are an agreement between RedLink GmbH (Redlink)(or based on where you  live,
    one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the release or pre-release software
    named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply
    to any Redlink

    • updates,
    • supplements, and
    • support services

    for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.

    BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.

    If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.

    1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

    a. Installation and Use.

    i. Redlink grants to you the limited right to use only one copy of the Software on a single
    computer in the manner set forth in this agreement.
    ii. You may not test the software in a live operating environment unless Redlink
    permits you to do so under another agreement.

    b. Third Party Programs. The software may include third party programs that Redlink,
    not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement. Notices, if any, for the third
    party program are included for your information only.

    2. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you
    some rights to use the software. Redlink reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law
    gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly
    permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in
    the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not

    • work around any technical limitations in the software;
    • reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent
    that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;
    • make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or allowed by
    applicable law, despite this limitation;
    • publish the software for others to copy;
    • rent, lease or lend the software;
    • transfer the software or this agreement to any third party; or
    • use the software for commercial software hosting services.

    3. TERM. The term of this agreement is until the release of the next version of the software, or
    commercial release of the software, whichever is first.

    4. RELEASE SOFTWARE. This software is a pre-release version. It may differ from the
    final version of the software. We may change it for the final, commercial version.
    We may also not release a final version.

    5. FEEDBACK. If you give feedback about the software to Redlink, you give to Redlink,
    without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for
    any purpose. You also give to third parties, without charge, any patent rights needed for their
    products, technologies and services to use or interface with any specific parts of a Redlink
    software or service that includes the feedback. You will not give feedback that is subject to a
    license that requires Redlink to license its software or documentation to third parties
    because we include your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.

    6. COPYRIGHT. The SOFTWARE is owned by Redlink and is protected by copyright laws and international
    treaty provisions. Therefore, you must treat the SOFTWARE like any other copyrighted material
    (e.g., a book or musical recording). You may not use or copy the SOFTWARE or any accompanying
    written materials for any purposes other than what is described in this Agreement. Redlink warrants
    that Redlink is the sole owner of all patents, copyrights or other applicable intellectual property
    rights in and to the SOFTWARE unless otherwise indicated in the documentation for the SOFTWARE.
    Redlink shall defend, indemnify, and hold Licensee harmless from any third party claims, including
    reasonable attorneys' fees, alleging that Software (including without limitation Sample Code)
    licensed hereunder infringes or misappropriates third party intellectual property rights.

    7. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to European export laws and
    regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and
    regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end
    users and end use.

    8. TRIAL. The trial versions of our products are intended for evaluation purposes only.
    You may not use the trial version to develop completed applications.  This agreement is
    protected by copyright laws and international treaty provisions. If you do not agree to
    the terms of the license agreement, you are not allowed to use this product or any part of it.
    Should you have any questions concerning this product, contact Redlink.

    9. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support
    services for it.

    10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-
    based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software
    and support services.

    11. APPLICABLE LAW. In the European Union, Austrian law governs the interpretation of this
    agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles.

    12. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights
    under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from
    whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws
    of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.

    13. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU
    BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. REDLINK GIVES NO EXPRESS
    WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE
    ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS
    AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER
    YOUR LOCAL LAWS, REDLINK EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
    OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-
    INFRINGEMENT.
