[abstract]
Smarti is a service component for conversational data. It allows to classify conversation intents, extract entities using
natural language components and makes this data actionable via turning it into queries for an extendable set of endpoints.
In addition Smarti is able to store conversations and thus suggest similar historic conversation flows for new messages.
